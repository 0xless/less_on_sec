      <description>Lock picking is the practice of unlocking a lock by manipulating the components of the lock device without the original key. - Wikipedia
 Locks are an universal item used to secure everything from homes and offices to critical infrastructures. They often represent the first line of security an attacker will have to face while trying to reach a target.
Although lock picking is often associated with criminal intent, it can also be an essential skill within penetration testers.</description>

      <description>Was working on something and got curious about the chunked transfer encoding, in particular about the fact that HTTP headers could be defined after the body of the request. Dug a bit deeper and found out it&amp;rsquo;s actually a known attack vector! Check this for more: https://swende.se/blog/HTTPChunked.html</description>

      <description>Raking is not really my first choice when it comes to covert entry: it&amp;rsquo;s easy to spot with forensic analysis and it only really works with low to moderate security locks. It can be the fastest and best choice for many situations nonetheless. That said, I bumped into this: https://elvencraft.com/lpd/Raking%20Techniques.html Awesome material on raking techniques.</description>

      <title>Bypass PHP addslashes()</title>

      <description>So I was working on a CTF and had to try to perform an SQLi through a PHP page on an addslashes() sanitized text field. Turns out the flaw was in a business logic and I was looking in the wrong spot, but I found this interesting article on bypassing this sanitization mechanism abusing GBK character encoding: https://shiflett.org/blog/2006/addslashes-versus-mysql-real-escape-string</description>
