It&amp;rsquo;s a domain with DNS zone transfer enabled, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to securely experiment in this field. On the website there is also a little guide to help interpreting the registers and their contents.</description></item><item><title>Business Card</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/smart-business-card/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/smart-business-card/</guid><description>{{ .Content }}</description></item><item><title>Walkthrough: CryptoHack CTF</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/posts/walkthrough-cryptohack-ctf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 12:41:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/posts/walkthrough-cryptohack-ctf/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to get into cryptography more seriously, and to be honest I&amp;rsquo;ve also been postponing it for a while too, so I figured it was time I wrote this article to get motivated!
I&amp;rsquo;m approaching this cryptography deep dive with https://cryptohack.org/. Cryptohack it&amp;rsquo;s website offering CTF style challenges to understand and try to break modern cryptography. I really like this gamified approach so I decided to give it a shot.</description></item><item><title>Curl_to_requests</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/curl_to_requests/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 10:08:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/curl_to_requests/</guid><description>Being a huge python fan and security enthusiast I find myself using python requests module all the time. To easily copy and edit/replay requests in the python environment I often use this tool: https://curl.trillworks.com/
Starting from a requests copied as cURL (with browser&amp;rsquo;s developer tools), it&amp;rsquo;s possible to translate it in many format, one of which is python requests'.</description></item><item><title>Php_deserializaiton</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/php_deserializaiton/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 21:18:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/php_deserializaiton/</guid><description>Found some notes I made a while ago while working on a CTF. Here are some great resources to learn what de-serialization attacks are and how to carry out a de-serialization attack in a PHP environment:

In this article I will describe step-by-step my experience with studying, reversing and understanding these devices.
In particular the analysis will comprehend:
Analysis of the board Analysis of the behavior Analysis of the signal This will allow to have a complete overview of the remotes.</description></item><item><title>Docker_privesc</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/docker_privesc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 May 2021 10:06:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/docker_privesc/</guid><description>Yesterday I was playing with linpeas and found a privilege escalation path on my system.
My user was automatically added to the docker group during the installation of docker. That means that my user has write access to docker.sock and can mount the local file system on a container to gain root access.
Running this command is all it takes to become root: docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock run -v /:/host -it image chroot /host /bin/bash</description></item><item><title>Battmngr</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/battmngr/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 20:09:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/battmngr/</guid><description>Wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied about battery management support my laptop had on Linux so I decided to write a tool for that. battmngr allows users to manage performance and battery modes with a simple script without the need to work with acpi_calls manually.

battmngr is now featured on ArchWiki and it&amp;rsquo;s available via AUR!</description></item><item><title>Templating</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/templating/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2021 19:52:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/thoughts/templating/</guid><description>Discussing with someone on Reddit, I realized that template languages are a powerful tool that can be helpful in many situations.
I&amp;rsquo;ll experiment with Jinja2 and probably use it to improve Intrudo.</description></item><item><title>Cloning RFID tags for fun and profit</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/posts/cloning-rfid-tags-for-fun-and-profit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 16:27:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/posts/cloning-rfid-tags-for-fun-and-profit/</guid><description>RFID tags are a technology commonly used but not limited to industrial purposes. These systems are in fact used every day as public transport passes, as security token in access control systems or as a digital &amp;ldquo;bar code&amp;rdquo; in shops. Given the diffusion these tags have, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how they work and the security implication of their use.
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.</description></item></channel></rss>
