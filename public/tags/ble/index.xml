The challenge is available at: https://github.com/hackgnar/ble_ctf and is an awesome tool to learn about BLE and get your feet wet.
To be fair I expected the CTF to be a bit more security oriented, but I learned way more than I expected, both on BLE technologies and on the tools used to interact with those.</description></item></channel></rss>
