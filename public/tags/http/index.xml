      <description>Intrudo is a tool for automating customized attacks against web applications loosely shaped after burp intruder.
Check it out: https://github.com/0xless/Intrudo
A little of background While working on CTFs I would usually write a bunch of lines of python to automate attacks, it worked fine, but I felt like I needed to improve my workflow. So I decided to learn new approaches and strengthen my use of commercial offensive tools.
I have used burp suite in the past, but I have not taken the time to explore it thoroughly, so I figured the best way to do that would be the labs that PortSwigger created for this reason.</description>
