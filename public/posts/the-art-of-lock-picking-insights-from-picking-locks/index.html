They often represent the first line of security an attacker will have to face while trying to reach a target.</p><p>Although lock picking is often associated with criminal intent, it can also be an essential skill within penetration testers. Like any other red team technique, lock picking translates to a defensive skill as it assists with finding and patching vulnerabilities. Since locks play such an important role in modern day security, it is important as a security professional to understand the lock picking process and what comes with it.</p><h3 id=lock-picking-is-hacking>Lock picking is hacking</h3><p>Picking locks is not so different from hacking a computer: you are faced with a challenge and need to defeat security measures to get to the target. In both cases to succeed, you will need a strong background of study and practice.
The passion for discovering vulnerabilities and the curiosity to learn about a technology is the reason why lock picking is so popular amongst security professionals.</p><blockquote><p>It’s another version of hacking. Hacking is all about using a system against itself, or bypassing a system by thinking outside of the box. Lockpicking is almost like a magic trick, a puzzle of the same sort. You can’t bypass it without using the lock’s systems exactly how they were meant to be used or by using it in a manner the creators never expected it to be used. - <a href=https://twitter.com/HydeNS33k>Jek Hyde</a></p></blockquote><p>While the technical knowledge received from practicing lock picking is useful, picking locks may be one of the least effective ways to enter inside a protected perimeters. This can be true for many reasons:</p><ul><li>Some locks can be <em>really hard</em> to pick open</li><li>Picking locks can take a <em>really long</em> time</li><li>Bypassing doors and locks is usually a more effective approach</li><li>Social engineering oftentimes works better</li></ul><p>While <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRXGIdg7eNE">lock picking has it&rsquo;s applications</a>, it remains an impractical technique for numerous situations. This then leads to the question: <em>why practice lock picking</em>?
The reason is simple. Lock picking and cybersecurity are similar in nature where the skills can become transferable.</p><p>Some skills that can be picked up from picking locks which apply to cybersecurity are:</p><ul><li><strong>Outside of the box thinking</strong><br>If a lock doesn&rsquo;t want to open, how can you make it do so? The more complex the lock, the more complex the solution can be. Though with the right intuition, you are in.</li><li><strong>Think like the enemy</strong><br>The only way to secure something is knowing exactly how to defeat its security measures.
Picking locks brings a new dimension to &ldquo;<em>thinking like the enemy</em>&rdquo;, since implications are projected into the physical world.</li><li><strong>Ethics</strong><br>A strong ethic is needed in both cyber and physical security. Considering different approaches with the same concept can add to an individual&rsquo;s experience.</li></ul><p>To conclude, lock picking is an important skill that gives a firsthand experience into the world of security. Working on a physical level can assist with understanding the security risks faced every day. <em>It is not possible to improve security without the understanding of how an attacker can defeat security measures that are in place</em>.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2021-03-01 18:06</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://lessonsec.com/tags/lockpicking/>lockpicking</a></span></p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2021</span>
