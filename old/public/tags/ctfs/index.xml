The challenge is available at: https://github.com/hackgnar/ble_ctf and is an awesome tool to learn about BLE and get your feet wet.
To be fair I expected the CTF to be a bit more security oriented, but I learned way more than I expected, both on BLE technologies and on the tools used to interact with those.</description></item><item><title>Walkthrough: CryptoHack CTF</title><link>https://lessonsec.com/posts/walkthrough-cryptohack-ctf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 12:41:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lessonsec.com/posts/walkthrough-cryptohack-ctf/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to get into cryptography more seriously, and to be honest I&amp;rsquo;ve also been postponing it for a while too, so I figured it was time I wrote this article to get motivated!
I&amp;rsquo;m approaching this cryptography deep dive with https://cryptohack.org/. Cryptohack it&amp;rsquo;s website offering CTF style challenges to understand and try to break modern cryptography. I really like this gamified approach so I decided to give it a shot.</description></item></channel></rss>
