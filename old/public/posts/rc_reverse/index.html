<p>A couple of days ago I found some old remote controls around the house and I decided it was time to take out my old RTL-SDR and put it to good use. In this article I will describe step-by-step my experience with studying, reversing and understanding these old devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/complete.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="board-analysis">Board analysis</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was to operate the remote, of course whenever I pressed the yellow button, the led on its side would light up signaling that everything was working fine.</p>
<p>The very next step was to open up the remote and visually analyze the board.
Inside the plastic casing I found this simple PCB.</p>
<p>Front:</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/front_pcb.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Back:</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/back_pcb.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>At first glance we can see there&rsquo;s and <em>antenna</em>, <em>a crystal oscillator</em>, a <em>trimmer</em> an <em>integrated circuit</em> and of course led, button and battery. There&rsquo;s everything needed for a radio transmitter to work.</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/clock.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at the components further we can discover something about how the device works.
In particular the oscillator gives away that the device probably operates at 30.875MHz - this isn&rsquo;t what I was expecting, in my country, <strong>Short Range Devices</strong> should work in the ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>27,5000 – 28,0000 MHz</li>
<li>29,7000 – 30,0050 MHz</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, for general purpose applications they can work  in the ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>433,000 – 435,0000 MHz (devices without a specific use)</li>
<li>862,0000 – 876,0000 MHz (devices without a specific use, wireless audio, alarm systems, social alarms, radio microphones, and RFID devices)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course at this point I&rsquo;m only guessing, but I&rsquo;m confident the working frequency would be around 30.875MHz.</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/dip_switch.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>We can also see that there&rsquo;s a 10-position DIP switch.
This component tells us that we are dealing with transmissions of at least 10 bits of data. I say at least, because it&rsquo;s possible that the device sends preamble/ending bits and/or checksum or parity bits.</p>
<p>Also, given the position of the switches, the code sent by the remote would either be 0001000110 or 1110111001.</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/unknown_ic.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the back of the PCB there&rsquo;s the ITF CIE9101 integrated circuit. Sadly I couldn&rsquo;t find any datasheets or information about this component (hit me up if you know something about it!).</p>
<p>We can analyze the PCB and see that this device is connected to the DIP switch, to the oscillator and to the antenna. We can make an educated guess and say that this IC is probably responsible for the radio transmission (in future it would be worth reverse engineering this IC to better understand how this device work).</p>
<h2 id="behavior-analysis">Behavior analysis</h2>
<p>The first thing to try and understand is the operating frequency of the device.
I did this with a Silver dongle <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/">RTL-SDR</a> and <a href="https://gqrx.dk/">gqrx</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/rtl_antenna.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once I opened gqrx, I tried to find the correct frequency. To do so I first checked the expected frequency we found earlier: 30.875MHz.
And the signal was right there. Well, for this remote in particular it was at 30.889MHz, but we found it!</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/gqrx_signal.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Once I found the frequency, I needed to check something. The first pin (1) of the DIP siwitch has written &ldquo;ON&rdquo; on top of it.
At first I thought that it was an ON - OFF switch, since there is none on the board, but I tried to change it&rsquo;s position and the remote would still work normally.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to analyze the signal.</p>
<h2 id="signal-analysis">Signal analysis</h2>
<p>What I did at this point was to record the signal in gqrx to analyze it.
Opening the signal in audacity shows the waveform we recorded.</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/signal.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see noise in the beginning and after the recording, this means that the center part represent the communication. Now we need to zoom in to try and decode the actual digital data.</p>
<p><img src="https://lessonsec.com/home/less/Dev/blog/drafts/rc_analysis_images/signal_zoom.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now clear that we are dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</a> and if we look closely at the signal, we can see that there are &ldquo;short&rdquo; and &ldquo;long&rdquo; pulses.
Those represent either 1s or 0s.</p>
<p>Now if we count the bit of data, we can see 14, but the switches in the remote were only 10. In fact, if we compare the signal to the position of the switches in the remote, we see that the pattern matches, with the exception of the last 4 bits. These bits (either 0000 or 1111) are trailing bits, needed to signal the end of the communication.</p>
<p>To prove that the signal actually corresponds to the one encoded by the switch + 4 trailing bits, I&rsquo;m using <code>rtl_433</code> to read the signal.
So we run <code>rtl_433 -f 30888000 -A</code> and we get this output:</p>
<pre><code>Attempting demodulation... short_width: 748, long_width: 1516, reset_limit: 5420, sync_width: 0
Use a flex decoder with -X 'n=name,m=OOK_PWM,s=748,l=1516,r=5420,g=1556,t=307,y=0'
pulse_demod_pwm(): Analyzer Device

[00] {14} ee 40     : 11101110 010000
[01] {14} ee 40     : 11101110 010000
[02] {14} ee 40     : 11101110 010000
[03] {14} ee 40     : 11101110 010000
[04] {14} ee 40     : 11101110 010000
[05] { 5} e8        : 11101
</code></pre><p>And we confirm that the signal uses a PWM modulation and is in fact 1110111001 followed by 0000.</p>
