An issue found in D-Link DSL-3782 v.1.03 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code as root via OS command injection in multiple setting pages.

Settings known to be affected by this issues are: 

- Subnet mask fields in network config
- Remote log server IP in logging 
- Every field in port forwarding functionality 
- Every field in static routes functionality 

The input provided by the user is insufficiently sanitized by the server, so bypassing the client-checks it is possible to inject arbitrary strings directly into `.sh` files. Depending on the affected field, the maximum payload length allowed will be different. Generally speaking, it is possible to inject between 15 and 50 characters.

To exploit [CVE-2023-27216](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27216) an attacker with remote access to the web interface of the D-Link DSL-3782 needs to inject a malicious payload into one of the affected fields. An example of working payload is: `; ping example.org #`.

I contacted D-Link two times regarding this issue and received no response.
The issue has been disclosed 60+ days after the first contact with the vendor.
