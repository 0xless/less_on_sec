title: "CVE-2025-65397: Insecure Startup Script Allows Root Command Execution in Blurams Flare Camera"
date: 2026-01-14T00:00:00+02:00

---

An insecure authentication mechanism in the `safe_exec.sh` startup script of Blurams Flare Camera version `24.1114.151.929` and earlier allows an attacker with physical access to the device to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, if file `/opt/images/public_key.der` is not present in the file system. The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a maliciously crafted `auth.ini` file on the device's SD card.

Vendor applied patches for the issue in software version `25.1119.177.2341`.
