Being a huge python fan and security enthusiast I find myself using python [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/index.html) module.
To easily copy and edit requests in the python environment I often use this tool: https://curl.trillworks.com/

Starting from a requests copied as cURL (with browser's developer tools), it's possible to translate it in many format, one of which is python requests'.
