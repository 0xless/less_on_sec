I've been studying and experimenting with DNS security and came across [zonetransfer.me](https://zonetransfer.me). 
It's a domain with DNS zone transfer enabled, it's useful to securely experiment in this field.
On the website there is also a little guide to help interpreting the registers and their contents.
