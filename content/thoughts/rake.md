Raking is not really my first choice when it comes to covert entry: it's easy to spot with forensic analysis and it only really works with low to moderate security locks.
It can be the fastest and best choice for many situations nonetheless.
That said, I bumped into this: https://elvencraft.com/lpd/Raking%20Techniques.html

Awesome material on raking techniques.
