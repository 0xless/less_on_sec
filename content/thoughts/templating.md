Discussing with someone on Reddit, I realized that template languages are a powerful tool that can be helpful in many situations.  
I'll experiment with [Jinja2](https://jinja2docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and probably use it to improve [Intrudo](https://lessonsec.com/posts/dev-chronicles-creating-an-http-attack-client/).
