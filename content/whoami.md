Hi, I'm Matteo [0xless] Cosentino. I'm a penetration tester by day and a security researcher by night.
I see hacking as a tool to learn new things and I’ve always been fascinated by breaking stuff.  

I often go too deep into technology related "rabbit holes", this blog was born so I can share my experiences and get motivated to finish what I start. `lessonsec.com` is a diary of my projects, ideas and experiences on security.
