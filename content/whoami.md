Hi, I'm Matteo [0xless] Cosentino. I'm a penetration tester during the day and a security researcher during the night.
I see hacking as a tool to learn new things and Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by breaking stuff.  
Of course I'm invested in software hacking, but I also enjoy exploring hardware and physical security.

I often go too deep into technology related "rabbit holes", this blog was born so I can share my experiences and get motivated to finish what I start! 

`lessonsec.com` is a diary of my projects, ideas and experiences on security.

If you want to get in contact with me, feel free to send an e-mail to: less@lessonsec.com
or execute `curl -L lessonsec.com/business_card` for more info.
