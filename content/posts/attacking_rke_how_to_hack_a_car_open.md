I've always found cybersecurity to be more interesting when  implications reflect in the "real world" and this is the reason hacking  physical devices is fun to me. Well, it turns out that the more the hack is controversial, the funnier it is to carry out!  For this reason I  got into remote controlled devices hacking, and in particular into car  remotes hacking. A while ago I got all the hardware needed to attempt  attacking these devices, so I could finally attempt some attacks.
